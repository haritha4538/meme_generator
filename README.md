## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the design and development of a project titled "Universal Meme Generator", created as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship. The project aims to simplify meme creation by allowing users to generate humorous and engaging memes using their own images and custom text. The development process involved applying core Python programming skills along with image manipulation libraries to build a lightweight yet functional application. This project enhanced problem-solving ability, creativity, and practical application of learned concepts in a real-world context.

## 2. Problem Statement

In the age of social media, memes have become a powerful medium for entertainment and expression. However, most online meme generators are either cluttered with ads, have limited templates, or require internet access. There is a need for a simple offline meme generator that allows users to add customized text to any image quickly.

## 3. Project Objectives

- Build a user-friendly meme generator tool using Python.
- Enable users to insert top and bottom text on any image.
- Save the generated meme locally with a unique name.
- Practice real-world development workflow using GitHub.

## 4. Development Approach

The project was completed in four key stages:

- **Requirement Analysis & Planning** – Defined scope, tools, and expected outcomes  
- **Development** – Coded core functionalities using pillow  
- **Testing & Debugging** – Iterative bug fixes and feature validation  
- **Documentation & Deployment** – Professional README and project structure  for clarity and submission
